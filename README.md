## ðŸ’» Project
Creating an application that simulates a market place. In this application it was possible to use basic fundamentals of React Native.

We can also select the items available for sale, add or remove items and check the total value of the order.

### ðŸ›  Using a fake API

So that you can see the application working, first of all, a fake API must be used to provide you with the data.

For that, I left installed in package.json a dependency called `json-server`, and a file called` server.json` that contains the data for a `/ products` route. To run this server you can run the following command:

```js
  yarn json-server server.json -p 3333
```
